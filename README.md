# AI emergency reception

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

In the emergencyroom reseption artificial intelligence quickly and efficiently interviews patients in order of arrival. Divides the patients in order of urgency. If necessary, it can send the patient home with instructions for home care, if the problem does not require emergency care. Refers to a nurse's assessment if unsure of what to do. The most urgent cases go straight past the queue. 


## Background

This would release nurses time for the more urgent jobs. There is a huge shortage of nurses, so this would save time and resources for the medical and nursing work.


## How is it used?

Users would be the patients who come to the emergency room, there would be a booth where the patient would go through. The interview would be conducted using natural language recognition and AI would record all data directly in the patient information system and add the patient to the waiting list.


## Challenges

There could be problems like not understanding the patient and the symptoms right, or not being fast enough with the interview, if there is a need for emergency care. There would be a need for a professional to check up on the decicions that AI has made. 

## What next?

There could be a machine vision camera, that would evaluate the patients condition. It would measure breathing, temperature, heartrate at the same time as the patient is being interview.
